## LYNX — STYLE CORE (applies to every screen in this batch)

**Product:** Lynx is an electronic business card app for iOS/Android. Users design a beautifully typeset, physically-textured digital card and share it by QR or NFC tap at job fairs and meetups. We are not selling a contact app — we are selling a **digital status symbol**.

**Aesthetic — "American Psycho":** premium, obsessively clean, driven by typography and subtle texture. Restraint above all; whitespace is the primary design element. If a screen looks empty, it is correct. Perfect kerning, exact alignment, generous letter-spacing on small-caps labels. Surfaces carry paper grain, linen, embossing, and light glare — the card reads as a held object, not a rectangle.

**Do NOT include:** bottom tab bars on the card screen, hamburger menus, illustration-heavy empty states, mascots, emoji, bright accent colors as decoration, drop shadows on flat UI, or any "friendly SaaS" voice.

**Wordmark:** `Lynx.` — always with the trailing period, in an elegant high-contrast serif (Garamond/Didot/Canela). Loose, optically balanced kerning. No accompanying icon or symbol.

**App UI palette (strict monochrome — all color comes from card materials, never the interface):**

| Token | Light | Dark |
|---|---|---|
| background | `#FFFFFF` | `#000000` |
| text | `#000000` | `#FFFFFF` |
| textSecondary | `#60646C` | `#B0B4BA` |
| backgroundElement (sheets, inputs, chips) | `#F0F0F3` | `#212225` |
| backgroundSelected (active row) | `#E0E1E6` | `#2E3135` |

**Render all screens in DARK MODE** unless a light variant is explicitly requested.

**Card "Bone" default material:** diagonal gradient `#FBFAF5` → `#E9E3D6`; primary ink `#1C1A14`; secondary ink `#4A463C`; name letter-spacing 0.5; labels all-caps at letter-spacing 2.5.

**Card geometry:** business-card aspect ratio 1.75:1 landscape, corner radius 12–16pt (a real die-cut card, never a pill).

**Spacing scale:** 2 / 4 / 8 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 64 pt, used strictly.

**Motion feel:** tactile and damped, never bouncy. The signature interaction is a realistic 3D flip with a light-glare sweep across the material.
